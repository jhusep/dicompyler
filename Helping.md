# Helping the dicomplyer project #

Dicompyler can only reach its full potential with the help of the user community. This help can take many forms, such as testing, coding, writing documentation, or providing test data.

### Bring out your DICOMs... ###
One of the biggest issues with using DICOM is that, despite its status as a standard, it is often implemented differently by different vendors. Because of this, it is important that dicompyler be tested on DICOM files generated by as many 3rd party sources as possible to build up _immunity_ (aka compatibility) to the diversity of different DICOM _styles_.

We ask you to test dicomplyer with as many different DICOM files as you can and file [issues](http://code.google.com/p/dicompyler/issues/list) if you have any problems.

Alternatively, you can assist us by sending us anonymized DICOM images or images of phantoms.

Dicompyler uses the excellent [pydicom](http://code.google.com/p/pydicom) library for DICOM support. When appropriate, we will send issues upstream to pydicom.

For more information about the DICOM data that has been tested with dicompyler, please see the [DICOM compatibility guide](http://code.google.com/p/dicompyler/wiki/DICOMCompatibilityGuide).

### Bugs. Report and/or squash em ###
Please take a moment to file [issues](http://code.google.com/p/dicompyler/issues/list) if you have found a bug in dicompyler. _Better yet_ send us a patch!

The basic way to create a patch with [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/):

```
$ hg clone https://dicompyler.googlecode.com/hg/ dicompyler
$ cd dicompyler
$ (edit files)
$ hg add (names of changed files)
$ hg commit -m 'My dicompyler bug fix'
$ hg export tip > patch.diff
```

"hg add" is only needed if you create new files. If you simply change existing files, skip that command. After exporting the changes you can send us the patch.diff file either by creating a new [issue](http://code.google.com/p/dicompyler/issues/list) on the website, or posting a message to the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/dicompyler).

**New:** As of version 0.4.1, if you are running from a binary Windows or Mac version, if you encounter an error, please consider submitting an error report, so that we can try to fix the problem.

### Write a dicompyler plugin ###
dicompyler is research a platform extensible with plugins. We encourage you to write plugins and contribute them to the dicompyler project and community.

Please check out the [Plugin Development Guide](http://code.google.com/p/dicompyler/wiki/PluginDevelopmentGuide).

### Develop dicompyler, make it your own ###
The absolute best way you can contribute to dicomplyer is to contribute code. Python is a relatively easy language and has a large, supportive community of users. dicompyler is currently using several technologies including:
  * [pydicom](http://code.google.com/p/pydicom) - pure Python library for DICOM access
  * [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) - an excellent plotting library
  * [NumPy/SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) - numerical and scientific libraries
  * [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) - Python Imaging Library used for image manipulation
  * [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/) - Python wrappers to the cross-platform wxWidgets GUI toolkit
  * [WxMpl](http://agni.phys.iit.edu/~kmcivor/wxmpl/) - a library for easy wxPython and matplotlib integration
  * [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) (hg) - a distributed source code manager
